problem = up.model.multi_agent.MultiAgentProblem('myproblem')
# specify the problem (e.g. agents, agent public fluents, agent private fluents, environment fluents, initial state, agent actions, goal)
...
plan = up.plans.Plan('my_ma_plan')
# plan generated by a Multi-agent planner
...
# Initialize the validator
validator = MAPlanValidator()
